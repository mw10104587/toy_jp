# Launching our toy application

#### Launching our toy jp project

Type in the following command at the project root directory.

```
// use virtual environment 
$ source myprojectenv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```


## Process of building this toy project

We have several biggest part of connecting different frameworks. We decide to use **Django**, **MySQL**
 and **d3.js** to build our application and show data and process to our users. Our main task is to link all of them together. Nothing was particularly hard, but it took us a while to understand the structure of Django and connecting it to MySQL server. 



## Database
#### Start mysql database
This part might be different for everyone.
```
/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.10/bin/mysql.server start
```

#### Log into database
Create a root user before you log in
REF: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11760177/access-denied-for-root-user-in-mysql-command-line
```
user: root
password: password
```

#### Create a database for this project
A) Create a database
DATABASE NAME: toy_jp
mysql> CREATE DATABASE toy_jp CHARACTER SET UTF8;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

B) Create a user and grant access to the database
mysql> CREATE USER mw10104587@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON toy_jp.* TO mw10104587@localhost;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

#### Some Settings
1. Create Virtual Environment for Python
2. Install django mysql
3. Migrate the database
4. Create super user

```
(myprojectenv)Chi-AnüÄÑÔ∏è toy_jp $python manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'wangchi-an'): 
Email address: cw2897@columbia.edu    
Password: 
Password (again): 
Superuser created successfully.
```

#### Populate the database
A) switch to the right database 
```USE toy_jp;```

B) `CREATE TABLE`
watch out for datatype

C) Add content
`INSERT INTO orders (company_name, quantity) VALUE ("Starbucks", 100);`


#### Use Model to access mysql database.
REF: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/db/queries/
The `Order` model could be found in `orders/models.py`. It will be included in dashboard for future database access.

<!-- Second Part About loading html files -->


#### How to Load an html file
**REF**: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14400035/how-to-return-a-static-html-file-as-a-response-in-django

**REF**: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/html/

A) Generated another app called the dashboard, in the dashboard I put all of my related templates in `/dashboard/templates/dashboard`

B) Set up views.py by adding
```
def dashboard(request):
	# get data here
	orders = Order.objects.filter(company_name="Apple")
	t = orders[0].json_object()
	return render(request, 'dashboard/dashboard.html', {'apple': t})
```

This function will be called and the specified html file will be rendered.
Things to note
1. setup the global url under toy_jp/urls.py
2. variables could be passed into the template by the thrid variable in the `render` function. In the template, just use it by the key value and wrap them up with two curly brackets. 
E.G. `{{key}}`


#### How to include database variables into javascript.
By putting the curly brackets in the `<script></script>` in template, the variables



# Testing
## Checking Database Functionality
After adding data, command line showing what's in the database `orders_order`, which means the `order` module under `orders` app.
![After adding data, showing database in cmd line](screenshots/before-delete-cmd.png) 
![After adding data, showing visualization result](./screenshots/before-delete.png) 

We try to remove data, and reloaded the page, and every worked like charm.

## Future Work
It would be more convenient to use django-nvd3 to develop reusable templates.
After we experienced it, we took it into consideration in next development.

#### Platform consistency
Our teammates half are using mac book and half are using windows, I believe we also need to make sure the compatibility of Python version, mysql settings.
