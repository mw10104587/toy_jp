# Process of building this toy project

We have several biggest part of connecting different frameworks. We decide to use **Django**, **MySQL**
 and **d3.js** to build our application and show data and process to our users. Our main task is to link all of them together.


1. Logging into database

2. Creating a database for this project

A) Create a database
DATABASE NAME: toy_jp
mysql> CREATE DATABASE toy_jp CHARACTER SET UTF8;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

B) Create a user and grant access to the database
mysql> CREATE USER mw10104587@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON toy_jp.* TO mw10104587@localhost;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)




3. Create Virtual Environment for Python

4. Install django mysql

5. Migrate the database

6. Create super user
(myprojectenv)Chi-AnüÄÑÔ∏è toy_jp $python manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'wangchi-an'): 
Email address: cw2897@columbia.edu    
Password: 
Password (again): 
Superuser created successfully.


7. Populate the database
