# Process of building this toy project

We have several biggest part of connecting different frameworks. We decide to use **Django**, **MySQL**
 and **d3.js** to build our application and show data and process to our users. Our main task is to link all of them together. Nothing was particularly hard, but it took us a while to understand the structure of Django and connecting it to MySQL server. 


0. Start the mysql database
This part might be different for everyone.
```
/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.10/bin/mysql.server start
```

1. Logging into database(Create a root user before you log in)
REF: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11760177/access-denied-for-root-user-in-mysql-command-line
user: root
password: password


2. Creating a database for this project
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-mysql-or-mariadb-with-your-django-application-on-ubuntu-14-04

A) Create a database
DATABASE NAME: toy_jp
mysql> CREATE DATABASE toy_jp CHARACTER SET UTF8;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

B) Create a user and grant access to the database
mysql> CREATE USER mw10104587@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON toy_jp.* TO mw10104587@localhost;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)


3. Create Virtual Environment for Python

4. Install django mysql

5. Migrate the database

6. Create super user
(myprojectenv)Chi-AnüÄÑÔ∏è toy_jp $python manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'wangchi-an'): 
Email address: cw2897@columbia.edu    
Password: 
Password (again): 
Superuser created successfully.


7. Populate the database
A) switch to the right database 
USE toy_jp;

B) CREATE TABLE 
watch out for datatype

B) INSERT INTO orders (company_name, quantity) VALUE ("Starbucks", 100);


8. Use Model as a higher level api to access mysql database.
REF: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/db/queries/


<!-- Second Part About loading html files -->


10. How to Load an html file
REF: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14400035/how-to-return-a-static-html-file-as-a-response-in-django

Even more helpful link from Django Girls
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/html/

A) I generated another app called the dashboard, in the dashboard a put all of my related templates in /dashboard/templates/dashboard

B) Set up views.py by adding
```
def dashboard(request):
	# get data here
	orders = Order.objects.filter(company_name="Apple")
	t = orders[0].json_object()
	return render(request, 'dashboard/dashboard.html', {'apple': t})
```

This function will be called and the specified html file will be rendered.
Things to note
1. setup the global url under toy_jp/urls.py
2. variables could be passed into the template by the thrid variable in the `render` function. In the template, just use it by the key value and wrap them up with two curly brackets. 
E.G. `{{key}}`
